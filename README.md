EXIFy (Safari Extension)
===============================

EXIFy is the easiest way to view EXIF data for jpeg and png images in Safari. It works in two ways:

1. Right-click or ctrl-click on an image and choose "EXIFy: View EXIF Data".
2. Right-click or ctrl-click anywhere on the page and choose "EXIFy: Enable 'Click to View'". Then, click any image on the page to view its data.

This repo includes both the extension source code and the built version. To modify and build your own, you must have a Safari Developer account and a valid Extension certificate.

EXIFy is released under the MIT license.
