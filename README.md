EXIFy (Safari Extension)
===============================

EXIFy is the easiest way to view EXIF data for jpeg and png images in Safari. It works in two ways:

- Right-click or ctrl-click on an image and choose "EXIFy: View EXIF Data".
- Right-click or ctrl-click anywhere on the page and choose "EXIFy: Enable 'Click to View'". Then, click any image on the page to view its data.

This repo only includes the extension source code. To build and test, you must use your own Safari Developer account.
